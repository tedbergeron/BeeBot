Two men are standing at the top of a cliff. One has two 
budgies, one on each shoulder. The other has a parrot and a 
shotgun.

The first guy jumps off the cliff and on the way down the 
birds fly away. He crashes on the rocks below and rolls over 
on his back. He looks up just in time to see his friend jump 
off too.

As the second guy falls the & parrot flies off, he pulls up 
his shot gun and shoots the bird just before he too crashes 
onto the rocks.

They lie there groaning in agony for a bit before the first 
guy says, &quot;I really don't see what is supposed to be so great 
about budgie jumping!&quot;
 
The second guy lets out a groan and says, &quot;I'm really not 
too impressed with free fall parrot shooting either!&quot;
