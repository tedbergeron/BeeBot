Today I rented a car to drive to class. I got the Pontiac Sunfire. 

It's white with a little spoiler on the back. One cool feature is the back seat folds down expanding the trunk into the cabin of the car. 

My daughter was tempted to crawl back in there to ride. I told her there were no seat belts back there, but I was really thinking how I would explain it to the cops if I got pulled over...
