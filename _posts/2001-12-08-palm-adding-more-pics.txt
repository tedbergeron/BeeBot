I'm adding some more pics that I snapped today. I am probably one of the worlds worst photographers. But I've always had a burning desire to take pictures and make movies. Which is the main reason that I bought this mini-camera. 

One thing it's digital. So I can snap and snap and all it costs me is batteries. I can examine my photos on screen. Whatever doesn't turn out, which is generally about 98%, I just delete. 

Plus everything that I create I like to put on the web anyway, so going digital just makes sense! 

Perhaps if I can learn the basics, it would be worth getting a real digital camera someday? But I don't think so I just don't get photography. 

When I was little, I wanted to be able to take pictures like my Dad. My first camera was a very inexpensive (read, _plastic_) camera. I took three or four rolls of B&W. I even took a couple color rolls. 

I think I still have them somewhere. Mostly I took photos of my pets. I learned at an early age that pets didn't live forever. I have a beautiful picture of my dog's ear. It was supposed to be a portrait of his head, but I had the camera too close. 

Then I have other pictures of my guinea pig where all you can see is a small black spot in the center of the photo because the camera was too far away. 

In high school my Dad upgraded his camera and gave me his old one. He taught me all about how to shoot. I learned about light meters, f-stops, the works, but still I took terrible pictures! So I concluded it was not an equipment problem, it was the monkey snaping the button! 

To this day my wife rarely will let me "waste" film, because she learned early in our marrage how bad I could be with a 'point and shoot' camera.
